‚è∫ PR Review: feat(Poodle/Admin): Hook up API to run Classic Migration (#27446)

Summary

This PR connects a new classic environment migration API endpoint to the admin UI, adding error
handling, validation, and user feedback. Currently approved by @julianahoneycomb.

‚úÖ Strengths

1. Good separation of concerns - Created separate useTeamESMigrationOperations hook for API calls
2. Proper error handling - Added try-catch blocks with user-friendly toast notifications
3. Form validation - Validates required fields before submission
4. UX improvements - Added error displays, loading states, and disabled button logic
5. Type safety - Well-defined TypeScript interfaces for API request/response

üîç Issues & Suggestions

1. Button loading state logic issue (index.tsx:210-218)

loading={!isDryRun ? false : isSubmitting || isMigrating} // Dry Run button
loading={isDryRun ? false : isSubmitting || isMigrating} // Migrate button
Problem: This logic may not work correctly. If isDryRun is false and neither button has been clicked
yet, both will show loading state.

Suggestion:
// Track which action is in progress
loading={isMigrating && isDryRun} // Dry Run button
loading={isMigrating && !isDryRun} // Migrate button

2. Inconsistent error handling patterns

- fetchDatasets/fetchEnvironments catch blocks set error state but don't log
- postMigrateClassic catch block shows toast with raw error object: ${error}
- Raw error objects may not display helpful messages to users

Suggestion: Add consistent error handling:
} catch (error) {
const errorMessage = error instanceof Error ? error.message : 'Unknown error occurred';
toastEmitter({
variant: "error",
description: errorMessage,
});
}

3. TODO comment in production code (index.tsx:83)

// Helper function to map resource names to API format //TODO: SG should this be moved?
Issue: Per CLAUDE.md guidelines, resolve TODOs before merging or create follow-up tickets.

4. Formik form submission not used properly

The form uses Formik but bypasses its onSubmit handler by calling handleSubmit directly from button
onClick. This means isSubmitting from Formik may not accurately reflect the submission state.

Suggestion: Use Formik's built-in form submission:
<Formik
onSubmit={(values) => handleSubmit(values, isDryRun)}
// ...

>

5. Missing cleanup on unmount

The isMigrating state could be set to true when component unmounts during an async operation, causing
React warnings.

Suggestion: Add cleanup in useEffect or use AbortController pattern.

6. Type safety concern (requests/index.ts)

The adminPostMigrateClassic generator function doesn't handle errors from \_adminPostMigrateClassic -
it just yields the promise.

üìù Minor Notes

- Spacing: The PR consistently uses 4-space indents in TSX (‚úÖ correct per guidelines)
- Naming: File rename from useTeamESMigrationFetchResources to useTeamESMigrationOperations makes
  sense
- API route: Added to app.go:590 - looks correct

üß™ Testing Recommendations

Since the PR description mentions tests will be added in the next PR, ensure you test:

1. Race conditions with rapid clicking of Dry Run/Migrate buttons
2. Error scenarios (network failures, validation errors)
3. Component unmounting during migration
4. Empty/edge case datasets and environments

Overall Assessment

Good foundation for the migration feature. Main concerns are button loading state logic and error
handling consistency. The architecture is sound with proper separation of concerns.
